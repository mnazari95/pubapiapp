### New York Times Article Searcher
Built using React JS with help of NYT API. The api docs can be found https://developer.nytimes.com/apis , a live demo of this application can be viewed at https://mnazari95.github.io/pubapiapp/ . This was tested/developed for the latest version of chrome web browser

### Features

1. Most popular api
    - displays current most viewed articles of the day (essentially presented as user first visits the app)
2. Article Searcher
    - using the search bar within the app, users can search for anything that NYT has published
3. Filtered Search
    - if users would like to filter their results, they simply can open the filter search by clicking onto the arrow down button.
    -to disable filtered search they simply need to collapse the filtered search panel by clicking onto arrow up button
4. Pagination
    -paginates if the searched results are more than 10

### Possible Issues
there might be a chance when the live demo won't work, in that case the api key may have reached it's monthly quota
